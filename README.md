# Student-Data-Management-App
Built a desktop application concept in Winforms and C# where students can login and view their own transcript, add/drop classes, and pay tuition and fees


## Description
This mock desktop application built in Winforms using C# is a UI concept for a possible replacement to my univeristy's (Stony Brook University) current student data management system. 

I designed this with clarity of data in mind, so that it would be easy to navigate for anyone choosing to use it, and that it would be simple to edit and change data at will.


## Tasks
- Build a desktop UI concept using Winforms and C#
- Make the UI easy to navigate and understandable at a glance to make user navigation as easy as possible
- The application should be realistic and follow the needs of an average college student managing their classes, scheduling, transcripts, grades, and tuition.
